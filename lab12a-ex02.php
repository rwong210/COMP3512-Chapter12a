<h1>Regular HTML section (outside &lt;?php ... ?&gt; tags)</h1>
<p>You can type regular HTML here and it will show up</p>
<p>The following line looks like PHP but it is ignored by PHP because it doesn't appear within &lt;?php ... ?&gt; tags: <br/><br/>
<code>
echo "This page was generated: " . date("M dS, Y");
</code>
<h1>PHP section (inside &lt;?php ... ?&gt; tags)</h1>
<?php
   //this is a php comment IN tags (will not appear)
   echo "This was output using PHP";
   echo "<br>"; //notice we can echo tags in php.
   $date = date("l, M dS, Y");
   echo "This page was generated: " . $date . "<hr/>";
   $remaining = 365 - date("z") +1;
   echo "There are " . $remaining . " days left in the year";
   
?>
